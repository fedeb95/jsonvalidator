# jsonvalidator

This simple script walks through all the sub directories, starting from the one specified or the current one if no arguments are provided. It prints a list of invalid JSON, so if the script gives no output either no JSON were found or all were valid.
Run with `python3 validator.py` to check files in the same directory of the script. 
Run `python3 validator.py /path/to/dir` instead to specify another directory to check.
